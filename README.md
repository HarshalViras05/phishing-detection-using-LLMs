# 🛡️ Phishing Email Classifier and Generator using GPT

## 📌 Problem Statement

Phishing emails remain one of the most prevalent and dangerous forms of cyber attacks. This project addresses the need for early detection and understanding of phishing tactics by developing a GUI-based tool that can:

* Classify emails as phishing or legitimate using a machine learning model.
* Generate phishing simulation emails using OpenAI's GPT model to aid awareness and defense training.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a cybersecurity tool leveraging AI/ML techniques for classifying phishing emails and simulating realistic phishing content for red-team awareness and training purposes.

---

## 🛠️ Features

* 🧠 Logistic Regression-based Phishing Detection
* 💬 GPT-powered Phishing Email Generator
* 🖥️ Easy-to-use GUI with real-time predictions
* 🔐 OpenAI API integration for dynamic content generation
